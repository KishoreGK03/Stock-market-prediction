# Stock-market-prediction

Stock price prediction is a complex and challenging task due to the dynamic nature of the stock market. This project presents a novel approach that combines knowledge graph and deep learning techniques to enhance prediction accuracy. By considering related stocks and mutation points, the model leverages hidden relationships between stocks to improve the prediction of stock prices. A piecewise loss function is introduced to address errors near mutation points, leading to more accurate predictions. 

  The algorithm combines ConvLSTM networks, knowledge graphs, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to integrate target stock features, related stock relationships, and mutation points for enhanced stock price prediction accuracy.
  By fusing information from diverse sources, including historical stock data, hidden relationships between stocks, and temporal dynamics of mutation points, the algorithm captures complex market interactions and improves prediction performance.
  Experimental results validate the algorithm's effectiveness in enhancing prediction accuracy and robustness, showcasing its potential to provide valuable insights for stock price forecasting in dynamic and challenging market conditions.
